Women in India face lots of social issues and problems all through the life which are big struggle for them 
right from their beginning of life. Female infanticide is the most common practice of killing girl child in
mother's womb in the Indian society. Women in India are considered as burden for their parents and husbands as 
they think that women are here only to consume money whole life without earning a little bit. Another common 
problem for women is sex discrimination which they face from their birth and continues till their death. 
Illiteracy, lack of proper education, responsible for household works, rape, sexual harassment at workplace, 
etc are some big issues for the women in India. However, a lot of positive changes has occurred in the women 
status as the number of educated people is increasing in the country.<br>

of female fetus is performed in the womb of mother after the foetal sex determination and sex selective

But from the above discussion we can't conclude this thing that men are totally blessed with everything that 
they desire and wish for..even they have to struggle a lot in their lives to earn everything..now let's 
gather some information about the same..<br>
Society has long perpetuated stereotypes and expectations surrounding gender roles, often overlooking the 
difficulties faced by men. While discussions on gender equality and women's experiences are crucial, it is 
equally important to acknowledge the challenges faced by men in today's world. From societal pressures to 
rigid expectations, this article endeavors to shed light on the difficulties associated with being a man. 
Emotional Suppression: Men are often encouraged to be strong, stoic, and invulnerable, which can lead to 
emotional suppression and a lack of emotional support. By constantly suppressing emotions, men may face 
difficulties in maintaining healthy relationships, addressing mental health issues, and experiencing personal 
growth. Pressure to appear strong can result in an intense internal struggle.</br>
Expectations of success: Men often face tremendous pressure to succeed and be the primary providers for their 
families. Societal expectations place a significant burden on men, forcing them to excel in their careers to 
prove their worth. Balancing professional and personal lives becomes increasingly challenging, causing stress, 
mental health problems, and feelings of inadequacy. This pressure can lead to sacrifices in personal 
fulfillment and negatively impact relationships, as men may feel trapped by societal expectations.<br>
Role Stereotyping and Toxic Masculinity: Societal notions about masculinity fuel a strong set of preconceived 
notions and stereotypes concerning male behavior, interests, and appearance. This rigid and narrow perspective 
can lead to a suppression of individuality and creativity. Men are often discouraged from exploring 
non-traditional interests or pursuing careers typically associated with femininity, causing feelings of 
confinement and a lack of identity expression.<br>
Limited Support Networks: Men often find themselves lacking the same level of emotional support and resources 
that are available to women. While strides have been made in recent years, access to tools for addressing 
mental health and fostering emotional well-being is still limited for many men. Societal norms make it 
difficult for men to express their struggles openly and reach out for help. This limited support network can 
lead to feelings of isolation and exacerbate mental health issues, sometimes resulting in higher suicide rates 
among men.
