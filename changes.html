Despite of the many challenges faced by men and women in earlier times, many reforms have now come that they
were expecting at that time..<br>
Since the bygone days, life, in general, has changed a lot. Modernization has been one of the most important 
elements of this change. Changes are visibly seen in transportation, urbanization, pollution, and numerous 
other fields.. Let's explore about differences on the basis of various ascepts..<br><br>
1. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF ATTITUDES & FEELINGS</u> => In earlier times 
people were more peaceful as they didn't have any complex economic, social or political problems & so their
attitudes& feelings were simple but people in today's time are more educated, open & free to express their 
opinions and with the complexity of their new lifestyle, their lifestyle and attitudes have become more complex.<br><br>
2. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF THINKING CAPACITY</u> => People used to be quite 
intelligent & had a great thinking capacity despite the lack of technology like that of computer. In addition
to this, we still have not been able to figure out some of their work like construction of pyramids etc. In 
today's time thinking capacity of people has widened. Modern technology also have a negative influence on
intelligence as some people use the internet to look solutions for their problems without thinking about it.<br><br>
3. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF FOOD HABITS</u> => Earlier diet of people 
included fruits, leaves & anything they found from the forest followed by hunting animals, planting & growing
vegetables and so people used to be healthy, they rarely had diseases & never needed extra exercise cause their
daily work kept their bodies running. Now-a-days, agriculture has turned into mass scale production using
machinery etc. Fast food is another major factor in modern food habits. Although many people find it convenient, 
it leads to many health conditions. Today people are unhealthy, needs medicine & functions on diets & exercise 
machines.<br><br>
4. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF CLOTHING</u> => In the past, people used to wear
simple clothes made of dry leaves slowly turning into different types of clothing. This got changed with the 
passage of time as people working in industries had to cover themselves to make sure they are not affected by
the chemicals. This got followed by long dresses and full body covered clothes. Now in today's time aspects 
like comfort, trend & style are what matters in clothing rather than the climate or region you live in like 
Indians wear their traditional clothes on occasions, but they are more into western fashions like jeans, 
shorts, blouses, & T-shirts. <br><br>
5. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF EDUCATION</u> => In terms of education in the 
past, people rarely got the chance to educate themselves. Farmers made sure that their children knew how to 
plot a farm and carry out their daily work. Yet with time, people went to the religious institutes like 
church, temple & mosque in order to learn. Later, people started learning languages & sciences with the 
improvement in knowledge. Most important fact is that all these changes in education happened only in lives of 
the males as the females were kept at home to do the daily work like sweeping, sewing embroidery,, cleaning & 
looking after children. This concept got changed with the revolutions that females started to fight for their
rights for voting, education and politics. These fredom rights were granted after several struggles.<br><br>
6. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF TRANSPORT</u> => In the past, people used
animals like horses, donkeys to travel from one place to another. With advancement in technology, 
transportation has become much wider, easier, and faster; there are a variety of vehicles to travel on land, 
air, and water. When talking about transportation on water, during ancient times, travels by ships took a long 
time, and many people died because of the weather and bad conditions of the ships. But today, there are luxury 
cruisers that carry supermarkets, tennis courts, swimming pools, houses, etc. Many people use airplanes to 
travel between countries.<br><br>
7. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF HOUSING</u> => In the past, people lived in 
caves, mud, and wood huts, etc. They used natural ingredients to build their houses. Housing over the past few 
decades have changed in terms of shape, mode of creation, size, place and purpose and so on. Today material 
such as bricks, cement, plastic and anything and everything is used in housing. Technology advancement has 
given freedom for the human being to go beyond nature to create human dwellings.<br><br>
8. <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAST & PRESENT LIFESTYLES IN TERMS OF RELIGION & BELIEFS</u> => During the past, 
people lived with the concepts of religion, nature, economy and village. These concepts were always bound to 
one another. Religion dictated their whole lives. But today the situation has changed. People are too busy to 
pay any attention to their religion and beliefs. The advancement of science and technology has also led people 
to question the validity of religion.<br><br>
